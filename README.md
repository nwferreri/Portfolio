A showcase of some of the Data Science/Analytics projects I've completed as I work to transition into the field.

Certificates for the courses I've completed as part of my Data Science program can be found [here](https://github.com/nwferreri/Portfolio/tree/main/Certificates).

Additional details can be found by following the link for each project.

## [Meal Kit Delivery Service Analysis using Power BI](https://github.com/nwferreri/meal-kit-delivery-powerbi)
In this project, I used Power BI to combine, transform, and analyze data about the performance of a fictional meal kit delivery service.

I created interactive dashboards with several features that rely on calculations(measures) created using DAX. These dashboards allow end users to assess and explore the company's performance.

The first dashboard is a high level overview, with tools to project revenue into the future.

The second dashboard is a drill-through from the Revenue by Division chart in the first dashboard. It shows information specific to a selected division of the company.

## [Excel Personal Budget Project](https://github.com/nwferreri/excel-budget-project)
In this project, I leverage several Excel tools (fomulae, visualizations, VBA macros, pivot tables) to provide insights into personal finance.

The Summary sheet provides a high level overview, using dynamically calculated formulae and charts to provide up-to-date information.

The Spending Summary sheet contains a Pivot Table that allows to user to see breakdowns of their expenses by category and year/month.
